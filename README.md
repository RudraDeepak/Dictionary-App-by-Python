# Dictionary-App-by-Python
This is a Dictionary project made using the JSON dictionary database which search for the word in it and shows its meaning if found and if the word is not properly pronounced than it shows recommendations also to make any correction in the searched word
In this program i imported 3 library modules :json,random and get_close_matches from difflib
json is a library module that is used to load and process the dictionary data which is used widely in datastorage in Python coding
random library module is used to generate the random number in this program
And the inbuilt get_close_matches module in difflib library is used to get the closest matchings of the words having similar character sequences with the word passed to it ,passing alongwith the json data file
